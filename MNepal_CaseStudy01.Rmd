```

## Introduction

The case study is based on two data set provided in data directory in this project. The data set used for this data analysis are **Beers.csv** and **Brewery.csv**

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
